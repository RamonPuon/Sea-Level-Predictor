# Sea Level Predictor

This project is part of the freecodecamp certification of [Data Analysis with Python](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/data-analysis-with-python/).

The data set was retrieved from [Datahub](https://datahub.io/core/sea-level-rise): Global Average Absolute Sea Level Change, 1880-2014 from the US Environmental Protection Agency using data from CSIRO, 2015; NOAA, 2015.

The objective of this assigment is to generate line of best fit in order to predict the global sea level change in 2050. Using data from 1880 to 2013. This was achieved using the linregress function from scipy.stats.

# Sea Level Predictor

This project is part of the freecodecamp certification of [Data Analysis with Python](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/data-analysis-with-python/).

The data set was retrieved from [Datahub](https://datahub.io/core/sea-level-rise): Global Average Absolute Sea Level Change, 1880-2014 from the US Environmental Protection Agency using data from CSIRO, 2015; NOAA, 2015.

The objective of this assigment is to generate a line of best fit in order to predict the global sea level change in 2050. Using data from 1880 to 2013. This was achieved using the linregress function from scipy.stats.

A linear regression using the data from 1880 to 2013 produced the following line.
